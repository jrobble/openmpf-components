# (double)- Weight of the sharpening paremeter.
# Default is 1.0, 0.0 = original image, higher values = sharper image.
SHARPEN: 1.0

# (double) - Image rescaling factor.
# 1.0 = Original image, higher values = larger image.
# Default set to 2.4 to increaese dpi for text detection.
SCALE: 2.4

# INVERT = 0: Disables image color/brightness inversion.
# INVERT = 1: Enables image color/brightness inversion.
# Disabled by default unless improvements are more noticeable.
INVERT: 0

# THRS_FILTER = 0: Disables threshold filtering of OCR results.
# THRS_FILTER = 1: Enables threshold filtering of OCR results.
# Threshold filtering checks basic character frequencies (vowel, punctuation, non-english symbols, etc.).
# Effective for shorter strings where english histogram comparison may be less accurate.
THRS_FILTER: 1

# HIST_FILTER = 0: Disables english histogram filtering of OCR results.
# HIST_FILTER = 1: Enables english histogram filtering of OCR results.
# Filters OCR results by histogram correlation to english character frequencies.
# Needs longer sequences of words to be effective.
HIST_FILTER: 1

# NUM_ONLY = 0: Strings that only contain numbers and punctuation (no english words) are rejected.
# NUM_ONLY = 1: Strings that only contain numbers and punctuation (no english words) are acceptable.
# Note, to avoid gibberish, threshold filtering on number lengths and punctuation frequencies are still performed.
# When threshold filtering is enabled.
NUM_ONLY: 1


# (int) - Specifies minimum word length.
# Default 3 = Reject output when all words detected (separated by whitespace) are 2 characters or less in length.
MIN_WORD_LEN: 3

# (int) - Specifies minimum number of english characters needed for a histogram comparison.
# Strings with less than specified number will only go through threshold check to avoid false negatives.
MIN_HIST_SIZE: 45

# (double) - Specifies minimum threshold comparison score (0-1.0).
# Higher values = stricter comparison to english character frequencies.
MIN_HIST_SCORE: 0.52


# (double) - Specifies max fraction of english punctuation in a detection (0-1.0).
# Default.35 = any detection with >35% punctuation characters would be removed.
# Ignores whitespace characters.
MAX_ENG_PNCT: 0.35

# (double) - Specifies max fraction of foreign (non-english) characters in a detection (0-1.0).
# Default .10 = any detection with >35% foreign characters would be removed.
# Ignores whitespace characters.
MAX_FRN_CHAR: 0.10


# (double) - Specifies min fraction of english vowels in a detection (0-1.0).
VOWEL_MIN: 0.10

# (double) - Specifies max fraction of english vowels in a detection (0-1.0).
VOWEL_MAX: 0.95
